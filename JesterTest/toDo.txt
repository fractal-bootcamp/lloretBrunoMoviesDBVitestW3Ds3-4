-- schema.prisma // Define the data model, relationships and constraints of my data.

--Model-View-Controller architectural pattern
    --Models: the structure of my data.
        - In the context of Prisma, your Prisma schema (schema.prisma) defines the models that map to your database tables.
            Prisma's generated models (PrismaClient) serve as your data access layer.
    --Controllers: Controllers contain the application logic that handles incoming requests, interacts with models (through Prisma),
        performs business logic, and prepares a response to send back.
    --Routes: Routes define the endpoints of your API or web application and specify which controller method handles each endpoint.
        They map HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to specific controller actions.
